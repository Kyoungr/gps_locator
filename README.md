This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# CSCI495-C5

## Description / Purpose
The purpose of this project was for me to get my accustomed to using external apis while building React components and implementing them within a react web application. The longest part of this project was understanding the vast variety of Google map props and how they work together. For my job in nashville I will possibly be tasked with building services with React and Javascript so this project helped me gain working experience. I enjoyed using Google's map api and playing around with different components.

## Future Work
This website is responive and visually pleasing but it lacks database connection and multiple map layers. In the future I will store user usage information and frequently visited locations. I am working on learning new frameworks as a whole but due to the time constrain I was unable to complete everything I had in mind.

## What is your major and how this project is related to your major.
I am an Information Technology/Information Systems double major with a full time offer as a software engineer. The company I will be working for along with many other companies use react and javascript for their front end languages. Building this web application allowed me to utilize my critial thinking skills and technical knowlege of software to build a simple but powerful web application. I also aspire to build my own website for my small business and this gave me the oppurtunity test out a possible frontend language.
